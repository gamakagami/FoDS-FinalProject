<h2>Project Name: Engagement rate prediction</h2>
<br>
<h3> Social media platforms, specifically Instagram, have become
an essential tool for both individuals and large brands to
engage with their audiences. Understanding the features that
affect the engagement rate is crucial to maximize the engage-
ment rate received from your audience. This study tackles
the challenges on predicting the engagement received by a
particular Instagram account, by applying machine learning
models. These machine learning models include gradient
boost, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, extreme gradient
boost, and categorial boostin </h3>
